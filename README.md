## Hi there 👋

Im Fachry!, trying to explore Computer Vision & Deep Learning.

### Next Projects I Want to Try:  
- 📝 Handwritten Text Recognition from A-Z  
- 👁️ OCR (Optical Character Recognition)  
- 🚦 Traffic Sign Detection & Recognition  
- ☝️ Finger Counting ([**completed**](https://github.com/fachrysann/FingerCounting_OpenCV-DeepLearning))  
- 🏷️ Emotion Recognition ([**completed**](https://github.com/fachrysann/EmotionRecognition_DeepLearning))  
- 🛣️ Road Segmentation  
- 🚗 Near Real-Time Vehicle Detection from Jakarta’s Traffic CCTVs ([**completed**](https://github.com/fachrysann/Car-Detection))  
- 🤖 Basic of Autonomous Car  


Most of the project probably run on local or just test it on videos file 💡
